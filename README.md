# Coffee Catcher
Coffee Catcher is a dropper game made for Jessica as part of Hack Club's Giftbox Secret Santa event! I built it with Python using the Pygame library, and I additionally created all art and assets!\

You are tasked with creating the perfect latte. Catch the coffee beans and creamer, but avoid the falling plushies! Once you've made your perfect latte, play again to view the different latte art, and see how fast you can beat the game again!\
